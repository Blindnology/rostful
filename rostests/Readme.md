Rostful RosTests
-----------------

These tests are here to verify the behavior of the rostful REST API with ROS in details.

They can be run with rostest/roslaunch, to make it simple for ROS devs.

They are also intended as a demo of how to use rostful in your ROS system.
Therefore the simplest shell interface, using ROS tools, and a json/yaml based REST test framework, is preferred.

For python debugging and unit testing purposes, python tests are available inside the rostful package.
These use python API to run similar tests.
