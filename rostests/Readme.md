Rostful RosTests
-----------------

These tests are here to verify the behavior of the rostful REST API with ROS in details

They can be run with rostest/roslaunch, to make it simple for ROS devs.

They are also intended as a demo of how to use rostful in your ROS system.
Therefore the simplest shell interface should be preferred.

For python debugging and unit testing purposes, python tests are available inside the rostful package.
These use python API to run similar tests.
